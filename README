toy_complex_quad_mix:

Trying to test which one is more accurate using a tot model
    1). fit for quad term separately, and subtract it from data, then use ML to fit for the remaining term
    2). fit for the original data directly using ML

====================================================================================

quadratic_fit:

Trying to fit the original data set using quadratic form at different value of x and y to see if a and b are consistent

Failed! At different position, even the value of a are different, when fitting y vs x1 or y vs x2. Also, if I perform a quadratic form fit for y vs x1 and x2, the absolute difference is very large, suggesting the chisq term is also very large and different from a quadratic function



Ask to save data in the format of (x1, x2, ..., y), instead of (x1_index, x2_index, ... ,y), also save sigma_i in the first k lines
